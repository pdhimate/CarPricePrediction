# This repo is part of my work at Deakin University, Australia.
The aim is to predict the price of a used car in Melbourne.

# Price prediction of a used car
This POC invovled scraping data from an Australian website for reselling goods called GumTree. I have not included the code used for scraping in this repo. The dataset is available in the repo.

# Technologies used
ML .Net, C#, VS 2019, .Net Core

# Features
The trainined model has a 60% accurancy and can recognize the following patterns.
- Price of a used car is directly proportional to the Year of Make. i.e. newer the car higher would be teh price.
- Price of a used car is inversely proportional to the Kilometers driven. More the kilometers lesser the price.
- Used cars with manual transimission cost less than an automatic one.
